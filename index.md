## RESEARCH & INTERN EXPERIENCES

Research interests：*Computer Vision, Multimedia, Human Computer Interaction.* 

#### Tsinghua University Human-Computer Speech Interaction Research Group (10/2017 – Present)

Advisor：Associate Prof. Jia Jia

#####1.Research on Aesthetic calculation (10/2017 – 06/2018)

Designing an AI Painting system which can automatically generate paintings with specific emotion and art style.

- Using style transfer and emotion transfer to render pictures generated by GAN.
- Analyze the function of each module and verify the effectiveness of our model.
- Co-authored a paper published in **MM’18.**

#####2.Research on Social Network Analysis (07/2018 – 01/2019)

Analyzing unfollow behavior of users on Weibo network and construct a model to predict unfollow.

- Established a benchmark dataset on Sina Weibo (containing 1.8 million users and 400 million edges) with the records of user’s post content.
- Performed data observation on the dataset and revealed key factors (social structure and post contents) related to user’s unfollow behavior.
- Proposed a novel model which outperformed baselines greatly.. 

 

####National University of Singapore NexT++ Research Group (01/2019 – 02/2019)

Advisor: Prof Chua Tat Seng

##### 2.Research on Social Network Analysis

- Further analysis on the mechanism of unfollow. Finding another fatal factor(unfollow history) related to unfollow.
- Improved the former model. The final model outperformed baselines by 24.5% on average in terms of accuracy.
- Submitted a paper to **AAAI 2020**(under review) as co-first author.

 

####Tencent WeChat department (03/2019 – 05/2019)

*Intern staff in Tencent WeChat department*

##### 3.Research on high-quality comment generation

- Generating comments for WeChat moments with high-level semantic information.

- Develop high-speed map reduce algorithm to handle large amount of data.
- Design filters based on statistical analysis to alleviate noise moments.

 

####Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute (06/2019 – 09/2019)

Advisor: Prof Martial Hebert

*Summer intern project*

##### 4.Research on Few-Shot Learning in Image Classification

- Analyzing on how to enhance generalizability of visual features with heterogeneous supervision.
- Constructed an benchmark to evaluate the performance and contribution of different supervisions.
- Analyzed the interaction of different supervisions and proposed an unified model to combine them all.
- Improved the performance of Few-Shot learning on Image Classification by 6% in terms of top5 accuracy.
- Planed to submit a paper to**CVPR 2020**as co-first author.
